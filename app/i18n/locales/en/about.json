Your work will be there tomorrow."

      "title": "Detail",
      "content": "Big picture work is important, it’s what we built this business on. But, we like the tiny details, ones that show we put a lot of care into something. It’s the little things that few people will notice – the code we rewrote even though we didn’t need to, the designs we scrapped along the way, the quality wood you use for the back of the cabinet that nobody sees."

      "content": "The Internet is a huge, wonderful place filled with all sorts of things. And some of those things simply spark joy.

In 20 years’ time, when people think back on their time spent with Ars Futura, we’d like them to feel like they had some good times."
